        After finishing a layer, the turtle goes back to its starting point 
        before beginning the next layer.  Not a huge deal, especially if I've 
        set unlimited fuel, but it's still inefficient.

        ...so he starts at S and ends at E, then moves back to S before 
        turning right, digging down, and starting the next layer.

        Once we get to E, we should turn right (west in the diagram above), 
        dig down, then restart the layer-loop.

New Minecraft Server Bootstrap {{{{
    Git script stolen from https://github.com/LNETeam/CCGit

    - In minecraft
        - create:
            - 1 basic computer
            - 1 disk drive
            - 1 floppy disk
        - Place the computer and disk drive next to each other.
        - Boot up the computer, create "jontest.txt" (on the machine, not the 
          disk).
        - Label the disk:
            > label set right init-disk
                - "right" assumes the drive is on the computer's right
        - Create disk directories
                > cd disk
                > mkdir general
                > cd general
                > mkdir bin
                > mkdir lib
                > mkdir etc
                > cd bin
            - So you're now sitting in disk/general/bin/
        - Change to the bin directory
            - Get my copy of the git script
                > pastebin get K7jCLz1i git
            - Get the turtlescripts market
                > pastebin get w1RtfqFd market

    - Put the disk somewhere safe so you don't have to go through all this 
      again.

New In-Game Machine Bootstrap {{{{

    - Load your init-disk you created in the previous step into a disk drive 
      attached to your new machine
        - The disk drive has to be next to your new machine on a side without 
          a modem.

    - Copy stuff from the disk to your new machine:
            > cp disk/general/* .

    - Grab my get_all script from github:
        > bin/git get tmtowtdi cc master turtle/bin/get_all bin/get_all

    Now that you have the get_all script, you don't have to type all that crap 
    ever again.  Just do:
        > bin/get_all

bin {{{{
    dig_cube {{{{
        Quarrying script.

        Digs a rectangle of a specified length, width, and depth, returning 
        its inv to a specified box.

        SETUP
        - Figure out where your box is
            - This is where the turtle will dump out its inventory.
                - It should be a double box, even if it's attached to a hopper 
                  (the turtle dumps its inv faster than a hopper can drain, 
                  and the turtle's inv is larger than a small box.)
            - Create a file in etc/ to contain your coords.  The file's 
              contents must look like this:
                        x: 123
                        y: 456
                        z: -789
              ...using the exact coords of your box.
            - The turtle will fly back to the box from above and come to rest 
              one space /above/ the box, so be sure the path above is clear.
        - Edit the script.
            - Set your desired cols, rows, and depth, all relative to the 
              start point of the turtle.
            - "highest" is the Y coord that the turtle will fly up to before 
              heading back to the box.  It should be high enough to not only 
              fly out of your quarry, but also to avoid any obstacles (trees, 
              mountains, houses, whatever) between your quarry and your 
              dumping box.
            - Set the name of the file containing your box coords.

    harvest_wheat {{{{
        TBD
            - Right now, harvest_wheat has the start point hard-coded.  Instead, the 
            turtle should record its position when the program is started and assume 
            that's the correct starting point
                - This assumes the user places the turtle correctly
                - But it also allows the user to move the turtle to a different farm.

            - At end, find a chest and
                - dump wheat from inv into chest
                - check own fuel level.  if too low, get coal from chest and refuel
                - check own seeds level.  If too low, get seeds from chest

            - Instead of assuming a farm is two double-columns of crops, allow an arg 
            to declare how many double-columns there are (I can see a villager farm 
            that consists of 3 double-columns).
