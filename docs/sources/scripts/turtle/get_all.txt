Get All
=======

Download the latest TMT ComputerCraft Utilities code.  This downloads all 
scripts and APIs.

If a new script or API has been added, you'll need to run ``get_all`` twice.  
The first time you run it, it will update all files it currently knows about, 
including itself.  This new version of ``get_all`` will now know about the new 
script/API you're interested in.  Now that it's aware, run it again to get the 
new file.
