# ComputerCraft Lua Utilities

This is a collection of scripts and APIs for the ComputerCraft addon for Minecraft.

## Install

In Minecraft, create a turtle and open its interface.

```
  > pastebin get JQsniAQj install
  > install
```

That install script will install all scripts and APIs.  Once the script finishes, you can 
safely remove it: ` > rm install`

## Using

Scripts are in `bin/` and are ready to use.  Try them out or see the documentation.  APIs 
are in `lib/`.  To use them in your own code, see the documentation.
